# Storage performance qualification

This directory defines the fixed QEMU `virt`/RV64 comparison contract. Results
come from guest production paths only; host-only adapters are not accepted by
the record validator.

`workloads-v1.json` is the complete qualification matrix. `schema-v1.json` is
the versioned JSONL record contract. Every coordinate has one of `ok`,
`unsupported`, `failed-closed`, or `inconclusive`; unsupported measurements do
not contain zero-valued timing fields.

The initial executable guest path is `object-durable-put-get`. VibeOS invokes
the selected M4 or Storage v2 `StoreService` directly. Linux uses the static
agent under `linux/` and performs:

```
write temporary -> fdatasync -> rename -> fsync directory -> read-back
```

The remaining block, file-tree, recovery, dedup, and GC coordinates stay in
the manifest so a qualification run cannot silently omit them while their
guest agents are added.

## Reproducible Linux guest

`linux/versions.json` pins Debian 13 nocloud build `20260810-2566`, its SHA-512,
Linux `6.12.101+deb13-riscv64`, and the ext4 creation arguments. The Debian root
and 1 GiB benchmark disk are separate virtio-blk devices. Per-sample accounting
is read from the benchmark device's own sysfs statistics, so root-disk I/O is
not attributed to the workload.

Prepare it with Docker and QEMU EDK2 firmware. Debian binary packages provide
GCC and e2fsprogs; the script compiles only the small agent, not a toolchain:

```
./scripts/build-linux-storage-bench.sh \
  /path/to/edk2-riscv-code.fd /path/to/edk2-riscv-vars.fd
```

Run an ext4 guest point with the same QEMU machine contract:

```
python3 scripts/storage-bench.py run-linux \
  --root-image target/storage-bench-debian/debian-13-nocloud-riscv64-configured.qcow2 \
  --firmware-code /path/to/edk2-riscv-code.fd \
  --firmware-vars target/storage-bench-debian/debian-13-nocloud-riscv64-vars.fd \
  --agent target/storage-bench-debian/storage-bench-agent \
  --data-image target/storage-bench-debian/storage-bench-ext4.raw \
  --object-bytes 4096 --vms 1 --warmups 1 --samples 2 \
  --output /tmp/linux-4k.jsonl
```

## VibeOS sample run

Build the dedicated feature path and run one short smoke point:

```
cd firmware/qemu-virt
cargo build --release --features storage-bench
cd ../..
python3 scripts/storage-bench.py run-vibeos \
  --kernel target/riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf/release/vibeos-qemu-virt \
  --data-image target/storage-v2-native-verified.raw \
  --object-bytes 4096 --vms 1 --warmups 1 --samples 2 \
  --output /tmp/vibeos-4k.jsonl
python3 scripts/storage-bench.py validate /tmp/vibeos-4k.jsonl
python3 scripts/storage-bench.py summarize /tmp/vibeos-4k.jsonl
```

The comparison command accepts separate result files, preserving their
provenance while rejecting duplicate sample coordinates:

```
python3 scripts/storage-bench.py compare \
  /tmp/vibeos-m4-4k.jsonl /tmp/vibeos-v2-4k.jsonl /tmp/linux-4k.jsonl
```

Full latency qualification uses the manifest defaults: five independent VMs,
five warmups and twenty retained samples per VM. A coefficient of variation
above 10% is reported as `inconclusive`. Baselines are immutable unless the
operator uses the explicit command:

```
python3 scripts/storage-bench.py update-baseline results.jsonl \
  benchmarks/storage/baselines/v2-baseline.json --update \
  --correctness-evidence qualification-correctness.json
```

The powered-off Storage v2 verifier and `fsck.ext4 -fn` remain correctness
gates outside timed regions. The update command requires both evidence records,
a clean recorded Git worktree, and every explicitly backend-scoped manifest
coordinate. A failed correctness gate or partial matrix blocks baseline update.

## Read-path attribution and focused regression

For `object-range-get`, `latency_ns` includes the initial durable put. Compare
`get_latency_ns` to measure just the range read. Linux range-get and large-object
samples now report both put/get phase latency alongside their composite total.
VibeOS records expose `phases.put_*` and `phases.get_*` I/O counts and bytes;
get counters are total minus put, and inconsistent totals are rejected. Zero
device reads may reflect the existing caches, not zero verification work.

The CAS streaming reader uses a 64 KiB content window and up to 16 hash pages,
all local to one invocation. The object range API authenticates the needed
envelope bytes with native CAS proofs and then verifies the outer blob proof.
Persistent/transient authority checks and small-object hot-cache generation
checks remain in place. The disk format is unchanged.

The focused 1 MiB host regression reduced PageDevice read requests from 781 to
34 and pages from 793 to 286, compared with the original CAS implementation
using the same harness. These are deterministic I/O counts, not wall-clock
speedup claims. The regression also checks unaligned and out-of-bounds ranges:

```sh
cargo test -p vibeos-segment-store --test perf_steady_state \
  large_object_append_and_cold_recover -- --nocapture
cargo test -p vibeos-segment-store --test cas_streaming
cargo test -p vibeos-object-store
python3 -m unittest scripts/test_storage_bench.py
```

The 2026-09-11 QEMU smoke runs passed for 4 KiB and 128 KiB range workloads,
and for range/full reads of 1 MiB objects. For the latter, get performed 28
device reads / 167,936 bytes for a 4 KiB range versus 40 reads / 1,216,512 bytes
for the whole object. Short-run latency variance was too high for formal
qualification. Local logs, JSONL and the detailed report are in
`target/storage-read-optimization-20260911/`; the formal baseline is unchanged.

## SD-oriented QEMU experiments

Both runners accept `--read-bps`, `--write-bps`, `--read-iops` and
`--write-iops` (nonnegative integers, zero means unlimited). They throttle only
the benchmark disk and record the limits in `environment.storage_throttle`.
Comparison rejects mismatched profiles for the same workload coordinate;
throttled experiments cannot replace the formal unthrottled baseline.
These QEMU average-rate limits allow bursts. They do not simulate SD commands,
card firmware, erase behavior or flush latency, and cannot qualify real cards.

The current v2 facade puts objects larger than 16 KiB into the existing external
content path instead of embedding them in the authority journal. The on-disk
format and recovery ordering are unchanged. Batched proof ranges share one
manifest resolution and bounded verification buffers (up to 32 ranges).
PageDevice reads reuse cached prefixes/suffixes, with at most one device read
per original hardware-sized chunk to avoid turning cache holes into many SD
commands. All returned content still passes the existing verification path.

The 2026-09-11 exploratory run used one VM, one warmup and three retained
samples, with read/write limits of 4/2 MiB/s and 400/200 IOPS. Baseline firmware
was built from `9ccce326f0fc2a79d804da9de1bf2eb59014ad75`:

| Phase | Baseline median | Changed median |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 128 KiB durable put | 552.664 ms | 58.909 ms |
| 1 MiB durable put | 7.560677 s | 1.333638 s |
| 4 KiB range read from 1 MiB object | 34.290 ms | 8.146 ms |

The put rows use the final external-content policy; the range row isolates the
batched-proof change. These short runs are not formal latency qualification.
For 1 MiB put, device writes fell from 4.24–7.13 MiB to 1.22–1.29 MiB per
retained sample, and authority growth fell from 2,962 to 2 records per object.
The range row still uses 28 physical reads / 167,936 bytes; its gain reflects
less repeated metadata/proof processing, not reduced physical read traffic.
The host regression separately reduces five native range reads from 61 to 15
PageDevice requests and from 91 to 21 pages by sharing their reader.

Reproduce a limited large-object point with:

```sh
python3 scripts/storage-bench.py run-vibeos \
  --kernel target/riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf/release/vibeos-qemu-virt \
  --data-image target/storage-v2-native-verified.raw \
  --output /tmp/vibeos-limited-1m.jsonl \
  --object-bytes 1048576 --workload object-v2-large \
  --vms 1 --warmups 1 --samples 3 \
  --read-bps 4194304 --write-bps 2097152 \
  --read-iops 400 --write-iops 200 \
  --boot-timeout 120 --sample-timeout 180
```

Local binaries, SHA-256 manifest, JSONL, summaries and test logs are in
`target/storage-sd-qemu-20260911/`. Validation covers CAS streaming/corruption,
object-store tests, exhaustive cache patterns, and crash cuts for external
objects of 16 KiB + 1 and 128 KiB. The final QEMU firmware passes selftests;
the Milk-V Duo target passes a compile check only. Large streaming puts still
issue roughly 281 writes per 1 MiB object, making bounded write coalescing a
remaining optimization opportunity.
